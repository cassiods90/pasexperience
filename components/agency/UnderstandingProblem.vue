                As stated, despite being a thriving industry, the creator economy still faces backlash from recent events and unregulated practices
                driven from the gig-economy as a proxy platform for revenue. Our intent is to tackle the root cause of this event by
                <b>nulling the quest for immediate financial return, and instead focusing on the work relationships</b> that will surmount to the
                aggregate coefficient that’s necessary to grow and thrive in this economy

                    It’s defined as the class of businesses built by over 50 million independent content creators, curators, and community builders
                    including social media influencers, bloggers, and videographers, plus the software and finance tools designed to help them with
                    growth and monetization.<br /><br />

                    More than 50 million people around the world consider themselves creators, despite the creator economy only being born a decade
                    ago. It’s become the fastest-growing type of small business, and a survey found that more American kids want to be a YouTube star
                    (29%) than an astronaut (11%) when they grow up*

                <span class="text">
                    Over the longer term, the creative economy is likely to be a key driver of economic growth as governments around the world look to
                    rebuild their economies in the wake of the downturn associated with Covid-19. It is reasonable to expect that the sector will
                    return to its long-term trend of growing faster than the wider economy as, for example, advertising is likely to recover strongly
                    with the wider economy and other sources of income have been more resilient. <br /><br />

                    Extrapolating from earlier trends suggests that the creative economy could grow 40% by 2030, adding more than 8 million additional
                    jobs, in the 9 economies studied*
