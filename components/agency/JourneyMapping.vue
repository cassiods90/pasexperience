                This map shows a <b>typical user journey of habits in alignment with the app’s usage phases.</b> From getting started, to becoming a
                regular and finally experiencing the desired results. We mapped out how the user might feel during the whole process and when they are
                most likely to quit. Two journeys are indicated: red is for the ideal path and yellow for the non-ideal

                        indiscriminately. It has become clear that Agency’s selling point must drive better connections through a qualitative search,
                        rather than quantifiable. Meaning, better to establish less connections that are more valuable, than more connections that are
                        invaluable
