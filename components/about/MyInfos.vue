                    >An immersive project-based program focused on learning best-in-practice end-to-end UX processes. During my time at Flag Lisboa, I
                    was able to work on various individual and group projects. These projects became an invaluable resource to further establish
                    guidelines for UX Research, when responsible for product design research and my main role meant understanding user behaviours,
                    needs, motivations and problems; Information Architecture, when responsible for structuring websites and applications, in order to
                    guarantee a positive experience for the user; and Visual Design, as a specialist who transforms prototypes into visual designs,
                    putting my knowledge about graphic elements, brands and styles into practice. Over this 14-week period I worked on productivity
                    apps, client projects and e-commerce sites. I practised the entire User Experience Design process, from user research to high

                    the different areas, the understanding of architecture was conveyed as: a cultural phenomenon, taking into account historical and
                    geographical conditions and heritage; an artistic phenomenon, taking into account its relation with Fine Arts; a scientific
                    phenomenon, taking into account the sources, methods, research techniques, validation and use â€“ as well as the architectural and
                    urban design; a technological phenomenon, taking into account the material realization of buildings, production, construction and
                    management; a professional phenomenon, taking into account the management of the regulating codes to the profession; and also as a
                    morphological, social and economic phenomenon.</span
