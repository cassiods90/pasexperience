                In the initial phase of sketching and ideation, our design team embarked on a creative journey to conceptualize the Agency app's user
                interface and functionality.
                <b>Through collaborative brainstorming and iterative sketching,</b> we explored various design directions to ensure a user-centered

                                In our initial sketch, we drew inspiration from innovative interfaces like those seen in creative software such as
                                DaVinci Resolve. Picture a visual platform where users merge skill nodes, each representing their expertise, creating
                                a dynamic visual map of potential career trajectories. This intuitive node interface translates the intricate process
