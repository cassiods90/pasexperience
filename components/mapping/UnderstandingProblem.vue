                According to PwC Global’s ‘Workforce of the future: the competing forces shaping 2030’ “(...)Three-quarters of people said they were
                ‘ready to learn new skills or completely re-train in order to remain employable in the future’ (...) And people are generally happy to
                take learning into their own hands with seventy-four percent of people globally agreeing it is their own responsibility to update
                their skills rather than relying on an employer.”*
