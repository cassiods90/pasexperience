                After gathering and organizing the research data, weâ€™ve created two user personas in order to be able to visualize the target
                end-users

                <br /><br />

                To guide us through the design process, we wanted to ensure that these personas accurately portrayed the different segments of our
                target audience, <b>the ones who are interested in re-skilling and the ones who are interested in upskilling</b>
